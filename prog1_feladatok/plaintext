why would you want to program? our civilization runs on software. without understanding software you are reduced to believing in “magic” and will be locked out of many of the most interesting, profitable, and socially useful technical fields of work. when i talk about programming, i think of the whole spectrum of computer programs from personal computer applications with guis (graphical user interfaces), through engineering calculations and embedded systems control applications (such as digital cameras, cars, and cell phones), to text manipulation applications as found in many humanities and business applications.
